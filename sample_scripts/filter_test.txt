# The `filter_add_files` merges the set of characters of each given file into the "filter" set of characters.
filter_add_files: lorem_ipsum_*.txt Cargo.toml
# The "filter" now includes all characters contained in "Cargo.toml", and also those from all files in the current directory which names start with "lorem_ipsum_" and end with ".txt".
# The `filter_dump` command allows writing this set of characters into a single output file.
filter_dump: filter_test_complete_charlist.txt
# We can request character ranges as usual; this time, only the characters present in the "filter" will be written to the output file.
